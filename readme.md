# Shift-Cipher Brute-Forcing Tool

This is a simple tool I threw together as a learning project in python.

It can return all possible shifts of a text using some alphabet.

It can do shifts on alphanumeric characters (where it shifts digits separate from letters), use all ASCII characters in sequence, or you can define the alphabet manually.

(*Note: To shift based on digits and letters in one sequencial alphabet enter it manually.*)

## Future Plans

- Would like to have the ability to detect the best alphabet from some text, or present the user with likely alphabets.

- Would like to make callable in terminal with arguments rather than current input method.
